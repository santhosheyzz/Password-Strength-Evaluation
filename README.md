## 🧪 Passwords Tested:

| Password       | Score (%) | Time to Crack        | Feedback                             |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| password123    | 24%       | < 1 second           | Too common, lacks complexity         |
| P@ssword2024   | 48%       | Few minutes          | Better, but predictable              |
| G@bY!t9kQ%     | 95%       | Centuries            | Excellent complexity                 |
| 7&uR@xL2#WpZ   | 98%       | Centuries+           | Very strong                          |
| qwerty         | 5%        | Instantly            | Extremely weak, keyboard pattern     |

## 🧠 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
- Use **12+ characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words**, personal names, dates
- Don’t reuse the same password across accounts
- Use a **password manager** for convenience and safety

---

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks:

### 🔸 Brute Force Attack
- Tries every combination of characters
- Time-consuming but effective if password is short/simple

### 🔸 Dictionary Attack
- Uses a pre-defined list of common passwords and words
- Quick and effective against predictable passwords

---

## 📊 Conclusion:
Strong passwords significantly increase security by resisting brute-force and dictionary attacks. Passwords with high complexity and length take **years or centuries** to crack, compared to weak passwords that can be cracked in **seconds**.

---

## 📝 Tips Learned:
- Don’t use names or common words
- Randomness and length are key
- Strong passwords = Safe accounts
